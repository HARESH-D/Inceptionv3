Inception v3 is a widely-used image recognition model that has been shown to attain greater than 78.1% accuracy
on the ImageNet dataset and around 93.9% accuracy in top 5 results. The model is the culmination of many 
ideas introduced by multiple researchers over the past years. It is based on the 
original paper: “Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision” by Szegedy, et. al.
